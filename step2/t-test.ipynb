    "# T-Test\n",
    "\n",
    "You have learnt all the basics of hypothesis testing. You are now well equipped to frame a hypothesis, test it, and make decision to reject or not reject the null hypothesis. (This is done considering the fact that the  population standard deviation for the data is known and the sample size is greater than 30.)\n",
    "\n",
    "But how will you test the hypothesis if these conditions are not fulfilled? Let’s find out.\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-distribution, as you studied earlier, is also a kind of normal distribution; it is also symmetric and single peaked, but less concentrated around its peak. In layman’s terms, a t-distribution is shorter and flatter around the centre than a normal distribution. It is used to study the mean of a population, when the population has a distribution fairly close to a normal distribution (but not an exact normal distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "Two simple conditions to determine when to use the t-statistic are —\n",
    "* **Population standard deviation is unknown**\n",
    "* **Sample size is less than 30**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if one of them is applicable in a situation, you can comfortably go for a t-test. The formula to determine the t-statistic is —\n",
    "![title](t-test.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, s is the sample standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at a problem to get a better understanding of the t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) stated that the **average number of accidents per month** on national highways is **12,000**. A researcher wanted to test this claim. To that end, he  collected **25 samples** for 25 months and found out that the **sample mean** was **13,105** and the **sample standard deviation** was **1638.4**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s now try to solve this problem according to the steps we discussed earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis for this case will be —\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ho** : μ=12000\n",
    "**Ha** : μ≠12000\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, you do not have the population standard deviation given. So, you will calculate the t-statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "t = (x – μ) / (s/√(n))\n",
    "\n",
    "= (13105 - 12000)/(1638.4/√25)\n",
    "\n",
    "      = 1105/327.68\n",
    "      \n",
    "      = 3.37\n",
    "      \n",
    "Now, as done in the case of a normal test, you need to compare the value you calculated with the tabular value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a 90% confidence interval and a sample size of 25, the **critical t value is 1.71.**\n",
    "\n",
    "(Here is a link to the tutorial of critical t value calculation: http://www.dummies.com/education/math/statistics/how-to-find-t-values-for-confidence-intervals/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, our acceptance region lies between +1.71 and -1.71.\n",
    "\n",
    "As our calculated t value lies outside the acceptance region, you **reject the null hypothesis** and can say that there is no sufficient evidence that the number of accidents is equal to 12,000 per month on the highways.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this example, you have a complete understanding of the one-sample t-test. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Two sample t-test\n",
    "Let’s now focus on the **two sample t-test**. As the name suggests, this test is conducted on two sets of sample data, in order to **compare the means of two samples**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that a two-sample test can be performed for multiple statistical parameters, but you are going to focus only on the two-sample test for means, where the population standard deviations of both the samples are unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the two-sample t-test is —\n",
    "![title](tow-sample_t-test.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that you want to come up with a hypothesis test regarding the mean age difference between men and women. You can use the two-sample t-test in such a case."
